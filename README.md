# Pottery Store
## Description
This web app is for a hypothetical pottery store. The goal of this project is to practice with unfamiliar technologies and cement any skills I have learned in my previous semester of college before returning. By the end of the project, this repository should contain a basic functional shop that could be cloned and turned into a real store.
## Planning
The planning process of this web app is documented [here](https://shocking-goldenrod-33e.notion.site/Shop-Application-234481d4e5df455899bd24b2d5535f08). This Notion site contains everything from user personas to architecture diagrams to a daily progress diary.
